  "description" : "Fixes a compatibility issue between old versions of Silverfeelin's Keybinds script and xStarbound/OpenStarbound where the script silently bugs out upon detecting these mods' [i]input[/i] table, preventing keybinds from working.\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\n\nThis mod fixes any keybind script [i]anywhere[/i] that looks like an old version of Silverfeelin's script. There may be potential compatibility issues if a modified Silverfeelin keybind script somehow actually runs a check for xStarbound's or OpenStarbound's [i]input[/i] table, but this is extremely unlikely because xStarbound and OpenStarbound provide a [b]Mod Binds[/b] pane and custom bind support in the engine.\n\n[b]GitHub:[/b] https://github.com/FezzedOne/Starbound-Universal-Keybind-Compatibility\n[b]Discord:[/b] https://discord.gg/GJ5RTkyFCX\n\n[b]Mod Pack Permissions:[/b] Anyone can include this mod in compilations without the author's consent.\n\n[b]Mod Assets Permissions:[/b] Anyone can alter/redistribute the mod's assets without the author's consent.",
