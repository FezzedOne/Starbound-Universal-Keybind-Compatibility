Fixes a compatibility issue between old versions of Silverfeelin's Keybinds script and xStarbound/OpenStarbound where the script silently bugs out upon detecting these mods' _input_ table, preventing keybinds from working.

# Compatibility

This mod fixes any keybind script _anywhere_ that looks like an old version of Silverfeelin's script. There may be potential compatibility issues if a modified Silverfeelin keybind script somehow actually runs a check for xStarbound's or OpenStarbound's _input_ table, but this is extremely unlikely because xStarbound and OpenStarbound provide a **Mod Binds** pane and custom bind support in the engine.
